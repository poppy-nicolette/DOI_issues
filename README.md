## OpenAlex
See conversations here regarding Crossref test prefixes found in the OpenAlex database. These are being removed per latest conversations.
 - https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-community/c/jAzCVy7BQMk
 - There is also a file located in this prepository of all DOIs in OpenAlex that were identified as Crossref test prefixes.

## cleaning
I have added some python scripts to identify and clean your Pandas dataframes of Crossref test prefixes. Feel free to adjust as needed for your case.

## DataCite
- [x] Mary at DataCite confirmed that they have test prefixes, but these are not exposed in their API or data downloads.
